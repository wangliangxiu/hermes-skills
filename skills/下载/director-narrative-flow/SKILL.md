# 导演模式 · 叙事节奏

## Overview

让多格"讲故事"而非只罗列图:镜头推进(建立→中景→情绪特写→收尾)、连续性(180°轴线/视线匹配/动作衔接)、节奏(交替景别、张弛控制)。

## When to Use

- 用:整段镜头如何排序、连续性与节奏把控;一组分镜读起来不连贯。
- 不用:只要一场戏的现成景别套路与转场标注 → 改用 `director-shot-sequence-patterns`。

NARRATIVE SEQUENCING — panels must tell a story, not just show images:

Shot Progression:
- Open with an establishing wide shot to set location and mood
- Follow with medium shots for character interaction
- Use close-ups sparingly for emotional peaks or key details
- End sequence with a resolution or cliffhanger shot

Continuity:
- Maintain 180-degree rule: keep characters on consistent screen sides across cuts
- Match eye-line direction between adjacent panels (if A looks right, B shows what's to the right)
- Action continuity: if a character starts raising a hand in panel N, panel N+1 shows hand raised or in motion

Pacing:
- Alternate shot scales to create visual rhythm (don't stack 3 close-ups in a row)
- For tension: decrease panel time span, tighten framing
- For relief: widen shots, increase perceived time between beats

## Example

4-beat sequence:
1. Wide establish — rainy alley at night (location + mood).
2. Medium — [char1] steps in, [char2] turns (180° line kept; both stay on consistent screen sides).
3. Close-up — [char1] eyes widen (emotional peak; eye-line matches what [char2] revealed).
4. Wide — both walk off (resolution).
→ Scales alternate (no 3 same-size in a row); eye-lines and screen sides stay continuous.

## Common Mistakes

| 错误 | 正确 |
|------|------|
| 越轴、视线不匹配 | 守 180° 轴线 + 视线对位 |
| 动作跨格断裂 | 上格起手,下格接上 |
| 连排同景别无节奏 | 交替景别,张弛有度 |
